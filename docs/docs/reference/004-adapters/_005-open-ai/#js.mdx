:::warning
This adapter connects to the OpenAI API directly from the browser using an API key.<br />
The OpenAI API is built for server-side usage and **the API key should not be exposed to the client**.

You can use this adapter for testing purposes, but in a production setup you should build your own server
that connects to the OpenAI API, and use that server with `NLUX`.

We recommend using [`NLUX`'s custom adapters feature](/reference/adapters/custom-adapters) to create an adapter for your server.
