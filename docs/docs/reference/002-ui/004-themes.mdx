# Themes

## Configuration

<p>
    A default theme is provided with NLUX, as well as a sophisticated theming system that allows you to create your own themes.
</p>

---

> ### Theme Id

A theme ID can be provided to `AiChat` as part of `displayOptions` to define the theme to use.<br />
If not present, the default `nova` theme will be used.

<PlatformSelector reactJs={ThemeIdReactJs} javascript={ThemeIdJavaScript}/>

> ### Color Scheme

The color scheme of the theme can be set to `light`, `dark`, or `auto` using the `colorScheme` property in `displayOptions`.<br />
If not present, `auto` will be used and the theme will switch between light and dark modes based on the user's system preferences.

You can override the color scheme by setting `colorScheme` as follows:

<PlatformSelector reactJs={ColorSchemeReactJs} javascript={ColorSchemeJavaScript}/>

---

> ### CSS

The CSS for the theme being used should also be imported into the project, or included as part of the build process.
For `NLUX` standard themes, the CSS can be imported from the `@nlux/themes` package.

Here is an example of how to import the CSS for the `nova` theme, in a project that supports CSS imports:

```tsx
import '@nlux/themes/nova.css';
```

## Themes Available

---

> ### Default Theme

The default theme that comes with `NLUX` `v2` is called `nova`. It's available in both light and dark modes and supports
all the features of `NLUX`, such as bubble vs list layout, custom renderers, and more.

In order to use the `nova` theme, you can import the CSS file from the `@nlux/themes` package:

```tsx
import '@nlux/themes/nova.css';
```

And you don't have to provide a theme ID to `AiChat`.

---

> ### Legacy Theme

The legacy theme that comes with `NLUX` `v1` is called `luna`. It's a simple theme that only supports light mode.<br />
It's provided for backwards compatibility with projects that were using `NLUX` `v1`, and it will be deprecated in the future.

In order to use the `luna` theme, you can import the CSS file from the `@nlux/themes` package:

```tsx
import '@nlux/themes/luna.css';
```

And you have to provide the theme ID `luna` to `AiChat`:

<PlatformSelector reactJs={LunaReactJs} javascript={LunaJavaScript}/>
