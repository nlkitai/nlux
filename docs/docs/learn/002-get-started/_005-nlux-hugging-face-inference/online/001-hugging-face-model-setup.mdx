In this guide, we will use [Llama](https://huggingface.co/blog/llama2), a state-of-the-art open-access large
language models released by Meta.<br />
To set up Llama on Hugging Face Inference, follow these steps:

1. Login to Hugging Face and go to [Inference Endpoints](https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/) page.
2. Click on _New Endpoint_
3. Select `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf` in the `Model Repository` field.
4. Select your desired instance configuration.
5. For `Endpoint security level`, select _Protected_ or _Public_ based on your requirements.
6. Click on _Create Endpoint_.

Wait for the instance to initialize. Once the instance is ready, you can use the endpoint to make inference requests.

* Before moving to the next step, make sure to note down the `Endpoint URL` from the instance details page.
* And if you have set the `Endpoint security level` to `Protected`, you will need to a generate user access token to
authenticate your requests. You can do that in the [Access Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) page.
