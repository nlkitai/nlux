## The Conversational AI UI Library For Any LLM

`NLUX` _(for Natural Language User Experience)_ is an open-source JavaScript library that makes it super simple to
integrate powerful large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT into your web app or website. With just a few lines
of code, you can add conversational AI capabilities and interact with your favorite LLM.

## Key Features 🌟

* **Build AI Chat Interfaces In Minutes** ― High quality conversational AI interfaces with just a few lines of code.
* **LLM Adapters** ― For `ChatGPT` / `LangChain` 🦜 LangServe / `HuggingFace` 🤗 Inference.
* A flexible interface to **Create Your Own Adapter** for any LLM or API.
* **Assistant and User Personas** ― Customize the assistant and user personas with names, images, and more.
* **Streaming LLM Output** ― Stream the chat response to the UI as it's being generated.

## Vanilla JS 🟨 vs React JS ⚛️

This package `@nlux/core` is the vanilla JS version of the library.
If you're looking for the React JS version, please check
the [`@nlux/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nlux/react) package.

## Get Started With `NLUX JS` 🚀

The example below demonstrates how to create an AI chat interface using `NLUX JS` and LangChain, the open source
framework for building LLM backends. But you can use `NLUX` **with any LLM** ― either
via the [standard adapters](https://docs.nlkit.com/nlux/learn/adapters) provided, or
by creating [your own adapter](https://docs.nlkit.com/nlux/learn/adapters/custom-adapters/create-custom-adapter).

To get started with `NLUX JS` and `LangChain`, install the `@nlux/core` and `@nlux/langchain` packages:

```sh
npm install @nlux/core @nlux/langchain
```

Configure the LangChain LangServe adapter to connect to your API endpoint:

```js
import {createAiChat} from '@nlux/core';
import {createChatAdapter} from '@nlux/langchain';

const langChainAdapter = createChatAdapter().withUrl('https://<Your LangServe Runnable URL>');
```

Then render the `AiChat` component into your web page:

```js
const aiChat = createAiChat()
    .withAdapter(langChainAdapter)
    .withConversationOptions({
        historyPayloadSize: 'max'
    })
    .withComposerOptions({
        placeholder: 'How can I help you today?'
    })

aiChat.mount(document.getElementById('root'));
```

You should also [include the NLUX theme CSS file](#theme-file-and-css-) in your HTML page.

## And The Result Is ✨

An AI chatbot, powered by LangChain, that can understand and respond to user messages:

## Theme File and CSS 🎨

You should include a **theme CSS file** into your HTML page.<br />
You can download and host the `Nova Theme` CSS file
from [`@nlux/themes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nlux/themes) package.
