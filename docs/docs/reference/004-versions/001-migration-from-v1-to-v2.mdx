# Migrating from NLUX v1 to v2

---

## Overview

<br />
<br />
`NLUX v1.x` was released in January 2024, and `NLUX v2.x` was released in May 2024, with several major improvements and
new features. The new version of `NLUX` introduces breaking changes to the theming system, TypeScript types, and the
`AiChat` UI component's config options.

If you're a user of `NLUX v1.x` looking to migrate to `v2.x`, this guide is for you.

Scope of the breaking changes:

* Theming system and default theme
* TypeScript types
* Config options
* Custom adapters API

---

## Theming System

<br />
<br />
`NLUX v2.x` comes with a new default theme called `Nova`.<br />
When you set up `NLUX` as per documentation and guides, you are expected to load the `Nova` theme's CSS into your 
web page, as following:

```tsx
import '@nlux/themes/nova.css';
```

We recommend using the default `Nova` theme, as it's a more user-friendly and accessible theme, that supports both
dark and light modes. But if you would like to keep the old legacy theme, you have that option.

### Keeping the v1.x theme

<br />
<br />
The `NLUX v1.x`'s default theme is called `Luna` and it's still included as part of the `v2.x` release, but not as a
default theme. If you're interested in keeping the `Luna` theme while using `NLUX v2.x`, you can that by providing
`themeId` prop to the `AiChat` component's `displayOptions`, as following:

<PlatformSelector reactJs={LunaThemeReactJs} javascript={LunaThemeJavaScript} />

In addition to that, you will also need to import the `Luna` theme's CSS into your web page.<br />
If your project bundler supports CSS imports, you can do that as following:

```tsx
import '@nlux/themes/luna.css';
```

Otherwise, you can download the `Luna` theme's CSS file
[from `@nlux/themes` `NPM`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nlux/themes?activeTab=code) and include it in your HTML file.

## Type Changes

<br />
<br />

`NLUX v2.x` has updated the name and value of certain types. Here's a list of the updated types:

---

### Participant Role

<br />
<br />

This value is used in the `ChatItem` type to define the role of the participant in the conversation.<br />

**Old value:**

```tsx
type ParticipantRole = 'user' | 'system' | 'ai';
```

**New value:**

```tsx
type ParticipantRole = 'user' | 'system' | 'assistant';
```

The `ai` role has been renamed to `assistant` to better reflect the role of the AI in the conversation,
and to match the naming convention of `OpenAI APIs` that are considered as an industry standard.

## AiChat Config Options

<br />
<br />
`AiChat` UI component's config options have been updated in `NLUX v2.x`.<br />
If you're using `AiChat` component in your project, you will need to update the config options as per the new API.

Here's a list of the updated config options:

| Old Config Option | New Config Option | Change Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `themeId` | `displayOptions.themeId` | `themeId` prop has been moved to `displayOptions` object. |
| `personaOptions.bot` | `personaOptions.assistant` | `personaOptions.bot` has been renamed to `personaOptions.assistant`. |
| `personaOptions.bot.picture` | `personaOptions.assistant.avatar` | `personaOptions.bot.picture` has been renamed to `personaOptions.assistant.avatar`. |
| `personaOptions.user.picture` | `personaOptions.user.avatar` | `personaOptions.user.picture` has been renamed to `personaOptions.user.avatar`. |
| `conversationOptions.scrollWhenGenerating` | `conversationOptions.autoScroll` | `conversationOptions.scrollWhenGenerating` has been renamed to `conversationOptions.autoScroll`. |
| `conversationOptions.streamingAnimationSpeed` | `messageOptions.streamingAnimationSpeed` | `conversationOptions.streamingAnimationSpeed` has been moved to `messageOptions`. |
| `conversationOptions.historyPayloadSize` | - | The type of `conversationOptions.historyPayloadSize` has been changed from `number \| 'none' \| 'max'` to `number \| 'max'`. |
| `layoutOptions.width` | `displayOptions.width` | `layoutOptions.width` has been moved to `displayOptions`. |
| `layoutOptions.height` | `displayOptions.height` | `layoutOptions.height` has been moved to `displayOptions`. |
| `layoutOptions.maxWidth` | - | `layoutOptions.maxWidth` has been removed. The default width is now `100%`. |
| `layoutOptions.maxHeight` | - | `layoutOptions.maxHeight` has been removed. The default height is now `100%`. |
| `promptBoxOptions.autoFocus` | `componentOptions.autoFocus` | `promptOptions.autoFocus` has been moved to `componentOptions`. |
| `promptBoxOptions.placeholder` | `componentOptions.placeholder` | `promptOptions.placeholder` has been moved to `componentOptions`. |
| `syntaxHighlightingOptions` | `messageOptions.syntaxHighlighting` | `syntaxHighlightingOptions` has been moved to `messageOptions`. |

Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of changes, and you should refer to the
[`NLUX v2.x` AI Chat component documentation](/reference/ui/ai-chat) for a complete list of changes.

## Custom Adapters

<br />
<br />

If you have implemented custom adapters in your project, you will need to update them to work with `NLUX v2.x`.<br />
The new version of `NLUX` has updated the adapter API to provide better flexibility and more control over the
conversation flow.

The most important change in the adapter API is the introduction of **generic types** for the `Adapter` interface.

Please refer to the [`NLUX v2.x` custom adapters documentation](/reference/adapters/custom-adapters) for more information on how to
update your custom adapters.
