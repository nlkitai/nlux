# Events

`NLUX` emits events when the user interacts with the UI, when server sends messages, or
when errors occur. You can register event callbacks to listen to these events.

---

## Listening to Events

You can register event callbacks to listen to events emitted by `NLUX`.

> ### Removing Event Callbacks

<PlatformSelector reactJs={RemoveEventReactJs} javascript={RemoveEventJavaScript}/>

---

## Events

Below is a list of events emitted by `NLUX`.

---

> ### Ready

This event is emitted when the `AiChat` component is mounted and ready to use.

> * Event Name: `ready`
> * Callback Type:

```tsx
type ReadyCallback<AiMsg = string> = (readyDetails: ReadyEventDetails<AiMsg>) => void;

type ReadyEventDetails<AiMsg> = {
    // Props used to initialize the AiChat component (excluding event listeners and adapter)
    aiChatProps: AiChatPropsInEvents<AiMsg>
}
```

> * Usage:

<PlatformSelector reactJs={EventReadyReactJs} javascript={EventReadyJavaScript}/>

---

> ### Pre-Destroy

This event is emitted when the `AiChat` component is about to be destroyed.
It allows access to the component's state, conversation history, and props before it is destroyed.

> * Event Name: `preDestroy`
> * Callback Type:

```tsx
type PreDestroyCallback<AiMsg = string> = (preDestroyDetails: PreDestroyEventDetails<AiMsg>) => void;

type PreDestroyEventDetails<AiMsg = string> = {
    aiChatProps: AiChatPropsInEvents<AiMsg>;
    conversationHistory: Readonly<ChatItem<AiMsg>[]>;
}
```

> * Usage:

<PlatformSelector reactJs={EventPreDestroyReactJs} javascript={EventPreDestroyJavaScript}/>

---

> ### Message Sent

This event is emitted when the user sends a message. The event only gets triggered when the
adapter method responsible for sending the message to the backend runs successfully.
For [standard adapters](/reference/adapters), this means that the message was successfully sent to
the backend.

> * Event Name: `messageSent`
> * Callback Type:

```tsx
type MessageSentCallback = (event: MessageSentEventDetails) => void;

type MessageSentEventDetails = {
    uid: string;
    message: string;
};
```

> * Usage:

<PlatformSelector reactJs={EventMessageSentReactJs} javascript={EventMessageSentJavaScript}/>

---

> ### Message Received

This event is emitted when a message is received from the server. For the case of **streamed messages**, this message
is emitted when the streaming is complete and the message is fully received.

Please note that `messageReceived` does not mean that the message has fully rendered on the screen. Depending on your
configuration, `NLUX` may render messages in a character-by-character animation, so the message may still being rendered
when this event is emitted. You can use the `messageRendered` event to listen to when the message has fully rendered
on the screen.

> * Event Name: `messageReceived`
> * Callback Type:

```tsx
type MessageReceivedCallback<AiMsg = string> = (event: MessageReceivedEventDetails<AiMsg>) => void;

type MessageReceivedEventDetails<AiMsg = string> = {
    uid: string;
    message: AiMsg;
};
```

> * Usage:

<PlatformSelector reactJs={EventMessageReceivedReactJs} javascript={EventMessageReceivedJavaScript}/>

---

> ### Message Rendered

> * Event Name: `messageRendered`

This event is emitted when the message has been fully rendered, including any animations that may be applied to the
message. This event is emitted after the `messageReceived` event, and will only be emitted once per message.

> * Callback Type:

```tsx
type MessageRenderedCallback<AiMsg = string> = (event: MessageRenderedEventDetails<AiMsg>) => void;

type MessageRenderedEventDetails<AiMsg = string> = {
    uid: string;
};
```

> * Usage:

<PlatformSelector reactJs={EventMessageRenderedReactJs} javascript={EventMessageRenderedJavaScript}/>

---

> ### Message Stream Started

This event is emitted when the server starts sending streaming a response back to the client, for when the adapter
is configured to use `stream` data transfer mode. The event will be emitted when the first chunk of the message is
received, and will only be emitted once per message.

> * Event Name: `messageStreamStarted`
> * Callback Type:

```tsx
type MessageStreamStartedCallback = (event: MessageStreamStartedEventDetails) => void;

type MessageStreamStartedEventDetails = {
    uid: string;
};
```

> * Usage:

<PlatformSelector reactJs={EventMessageStreamStartedReactJs} javascript={EventMessageStreamStartedJavaScript}/>

---

> ### Error

This event is emitted when an exception occurs. The event listener receives the `ErrorEventDetails` object
as a parameter.

> * Event Name: `error`
> * Callback Type:

```tsx
type ErrorCallback = (errorDetails: ErrorEventDetails) => void;

type ErrorEventDetails = {
    errorId: string;
    message: string;
    errorObject?: Error;
};
```

> * Usage:

<PlatformSelector reactJs={EventErrorReactJs} javascript={EventErrorJavaScript}/>
