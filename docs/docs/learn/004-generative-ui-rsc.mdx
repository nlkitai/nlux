# Generative UIs, Vercel AI, and NLUX RSC Adapter

Generative UIs allow developers to create dynamic and rich content powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).
In this guide, you will learn about Generative UIs, and how to use them as chat responses in NLUX.

## What Are Generative UIs?
<br /><br />

Generative User Interfaces (UIs) are a new paradigm in web development that allows developers to create dynamic and
interactive user interfaces using AI-generated content. One of the pioneer projects in this space is
[v0](https://vercel.com/blog/announcing-v0-generative-ui), by Vercel, which enables developers to build UIs using
natural language prompts.

While the success of v0 has been limited, the concept has gained traction in the frontend developers community.<br />
Today, the production-ready version of Generative UIs is less about generating UIs from scratch using natural language
prompts and more about using AI to pre-fill UI components with data. This feature was introduced in
[Vercel AI SDK](https://vercel.com/blog/ai-sdk-3-generative-ui) and is now supported by NLUX.

## What Are React Server Components?
<br /><br />

React Server Components are a new feature in React that allows developers to render HTML an HTML representation on the
server and send it to the client in a serialized form that can be interpreted in the browser and rendered as a part of
React component tree.

Combining Generative UIs with React Server Components allows developers to create rich and interactive React Components
on the server-side using AI-generated content.

---

## How Do They Integrate With NLUX?
<br /><br />

`NLUX` is a library that simplifies the process of building AI-powered conversational interfaces. It provides a set of
adapters that allow developers to connect their chat UIs to different AI services and models.

In the context of Generative UIs and React Server Components, `NLUX` provides an adapter that allows developers to use
React Server Components as chat responses. This means that when a user sends a message to the chatbot, the response can
be a React component generated by an AI model, rather than a simple text message or markdown.

---

## Example: Vercel AI SDK with NLUX RSC Adapter
<br /><br />

To demonstrate how Generative UIs can be used with NLUX, let's create a simple chatbot that uses the Vercel AI SDK to
generate responses using React Server Components.

---

### 1. Create a New Project
<br /><br />

First, create a new project using the NLUX CLI:

```bash
npx nlux-cli create nextjs my-app-name
cd my-app-name
```

Add vercel AI SDK and other dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-exact @ai-sdk/openai ai@3.1.31 zod
```

:::note ai@3.1.31
Here we specifically install `ai@3.1.31` as the latest version of `ai` NPM package contains a bug that prevents the
Vercel AI SDK from working correctly. It's being tracked in this [issue](https://github.com/vercel/ai/issues/1933) and
we will update this guide once the issue is resolved.
:::

Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

---

### 2. Add Server Component
<br /><br />

We will start by creating a new server component that will be used as a chat response.

Create a new file `src/app/generativeUi.ts`, and add the following code:

```jsx
'use server';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

export default async function streamComponent(prompt: string) {
    const result = await generateText({
        model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),
        messages: [{
            role: 'user',
            content: prompt,
        }],
    });

    return (
        <div style={{padding: '1rem', borderRadius: 10, border: '1px solid #f75f02'}}>
            {result.text}
        </div>
    )
};
```

This simple server component takes a prompt as input, generates a response using the Vercel AI SDK, and returns a
React component that displays the generated text.

Notice the `'use server';` directive at the top of the file. This tells the Next.js that the file should be executed
on the server-side.

---

### 3. Add NLUX RSC Adapter
<br /><br />

Next, we will add the NLUX RSC adapter to our project. This adapter allows us to use React Server Components as chat
responses.

Modify the `src/app/page.tsx` file to use the NLUX RSC adapter as follows:

```tsx
'use client';

import {AiChat, useAsRscAdapter} from '@nlux/react';
import '@nlux/themes/nova.css';

export default function HomePage() {
    const chatAdapter = useAsRscAdapter(
        import('./generativeUi'),
        <span>Connecting</span>
    );

    return <AiChat adapter={chatAdapter}/>
}
```

Notice the `'use client';` directive at the top of the file. This tells Next.js that the file should be executed on the
client-side.

---

### 4. Run The Project
<br /><br />

Run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The result should be as follows:

<center>
    <video controls={false} autoPlay={true} loop style={{ width: '600px', height: '407px', borderRadius: '20px', backgroundColor: 'black' }}>
        <source src={useBaseUrl('/videos/learn/generative-ui-rsc/rsc-ui-nlux.mp4')} type="video/mp4" />
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
</center>

As you can see, the chatbot now responds with a React component generated by the server component we created earlier.

---

### 5. Adding AI-Generated UI Components
<br /><br />

Next, we are going to enhance the server component to generate UI components populated with data from the AI model.

Modify the `src/app/generativeUi.ts` file as follows:

```jsx
'use server';

import SalesOverview from '@/app/sales-graph';
import {streamUI} from 'ai/rsc';
import {openai} from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import {z} from 'zod';

const LoadingComponent = () => (
    <div className="animate-pulse p-4">Generating</div>
);

export default async function streamComponent(prompt: string) {
    const result = await streamUI({
        model: openai('gpt-4o'),
        prompt,
        text: ({content}) => <div>{content}</div>,
        tools: {
            salesOverview: {
                description: 'Show a graph with an overview of sales',
                parameters: z.object({
                    title: z.string(),
                    data: z.array(z.object({
                        item: z.string(),
                        percentage: z.number(),
                    })),
                }),
                generate: async function* ({title, data}) {
                    yield <LoadingComponent/>;
                    return <SalesOverview title={title} data={data} />;
                },
            },
        },
    });

    return result.value;
}
```

And add the following RSC component in `src/app/sales-graph.tsx`:

```tsx
export default function sales({data, title} : {title: string, data: SalesData}) {
    return (
        <div>
            <div>{title}</div>
            {data.map(({percentage, item}) => (
                <div key={item}><span>{item}: {percentage}%</span></div>
            ))}
        </div>
    );
};
```

When you run the project, if prompted about generating a sales overview, the chatbot will respond with a React component
that displays a graph of sales data.

Let's review the changes made to the `src/app/generativeUi.ts` file:

* We import the `SalesOverview` component from `src/app/sales-graph.tsx`.
* We use `streamUI` from the `ai/rsc` module to generate UI components.
* We define a tool called `salesOverview` that generates a sales graph component.
* The `generate` function yields a loading component while the data is being fetched, and then returns the `SalesOverview`
component with the fetched data.

Those features are part of the Vercel AI SDK and are now supported by NLUX through the RSC adapter.
