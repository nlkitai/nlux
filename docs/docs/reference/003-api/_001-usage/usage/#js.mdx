As for now, The `API` features are only supported for the React JS version of `NLUX`.

If you're using the plain `JavaScript` and would like to use the `API` features, please contact us on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/SRwDmZghNB) or created a feature request on [GitHub](https://github.com/nlkitai/nlux/issues).

The `NLUX` team also offers **prioritised feature requests** implementation for
[Enterprise](https://www.nlkit.com/enterprise) users.<br />
