# Events

`nlux` emits events when the user interacts with the UI, when server sends a message, or
when errors occur. You can register event listeners to listen to these events.

<PlatformSelector reactJs={EventListenersReactJs} javascript={EventListenersJavascript}/>

## Event Listeners

You can register event listeners to listen to events emitted by the AI chat UI component.

Events are emitted when the user interacts with the UI, when server sends a message, or
when errors occur.

### Listen To An Event

<PlatformSection reactJs={RegisterEventReactJs} javascript={RegisterEventJavascript}/>

---

### Remove An Event Listener

<PlatformSection reactJs={RemoveEventReactJs} javascript={RemoveEventJavascript}/>

---

## Events

Below is a list of events emitted by the AI chat UI component.

---

### Ready

* Event Name: `ready`

This event is emitted when the AI chat UI component is mounted and ready to use.

* Callback Type:

```ts
type ReadyEventDetails = {
    // Props used to initialize the AiChat component
    aiChatProps: AiChatProps;
};

type ReadyCallback = (readyDetails: ReadyEventDetails) => void;
```

* Example:

<PlatformSelector reactJs={EventReadyReactJs} javascript={EventReadyJavascript}/>

---

### Pre-Destroy

* Event Name: `preDestroy`

This event is emitted when the AI chat UI component is about to be destroyed.
It allows access to the component's state and props before it is destroyed.

* Callback Type:

```ts
type PreDestroyEventDetails = {
    aiChatProps: AiChatProps;
    conversationHistory: Readonly<ConversationItem[]>;
};

type PreDestroyCallback = (preDestroyDetails: PreDestroyEventDetails) => void;
```

* Example:

<PlatformSelector reactJs={EventPreDestroyReactJs} javascript={EventPreDestroyJavascript}/>

---

### Message Sent

* Event Name: `messageSent`

This event is emitted when the user sends a message. The event only gets triggered when the
adapter method responsible for sending the message to the backend executes successfully.
For [standard adapters](/api/adapters), this means that the message was successfully sent to
the backend.

* Callback Type:

```ts
type MessageSentCallback = (message: string) => void;
```

* Example:

<PlatformSelector reactJs={EventMessageSentReactJs} javascript={EventMessageSentJavascript}/>

---

### Message Received

* Event Name: `messageReceived`

This event is emitted when a message is received from the server. The event listener receives the
message as a parameter.

| For [Promise Adapters](/api/adapters/custom-adapters#promise-adapters) ― The event listener receives when the promise
is resolved.<br />
| For [Streaming Adapters](/api/adapters/custom-adapters#streaming-adapters) ― The event listener receives the message
when the streaming is complete and the message is fully received.

Please note that `messageReceived` does not mean that the message has fully rendered on the screen.
`nlux` renders the messages in a character-by-character animation, so the message may still being
rendered when this event is emitted.

* Callback Type:

```ts
type MessageReceivedCallback = (message: string) => void;
```

* Example:

<PlatformSelector reactJs={EventMessageReceivedReactJs} javascript={EventMessageReceivedJavascript}/>

---

### Error

* Event Name: `error`

This event is emitted when an exception occurs. The event listener receives the `ErrorEventDetails` object
as a parameter.

* Callback Type:

```typescript
type ErrorEventDetails = {
    errorId: string;
    message: string;
};

type ErrorCallback = (error: ErrorEventDetails) => void;
```

* Example:

<PlatformSelector reactJs={EventErrorReactJs} javascript={EventErrorJavascript}/>
