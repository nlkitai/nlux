# Context-Aware Conversations

`NLUX` allows users to provide context to your AI system based on information available
in the application. This is done though:

* `createAiContext()` - To create React context to wrap the part of your application where you want to provide context.
* `useAiContext()` / `useAiTask()` - Hooks to sync the context with the backend.

## Example

The following is a screenshot of a [demo application](https://github.com/nluxai/demos) that uses context-aware conversations:

#### Here is what makes the demo application context-aware:

* When the user types `Filter by HK stock exchange`, a filter for the Hong Kong stock exchange was applied: The AI
chatbot understood the request and triggered the filter.
* When the user asked the generic question `What is 1299 ?`, the application provided an answer specific to what
the user is seeing on their screen.

If the user changes the page, or the context changes, the AI system will be aware of the change and will keep
providing relevant responses.

## How It Works

* The user registers relevant context items with `useAiContext()` — They will automatically be sent to the AI system
when the context changes, and cleared when related components are unmounted.
* The user registers relevant tasks to trigger by AI using `useAiTask()`.
* The `<AiChat />` component is configured to use the `@nlux/nlbridge-react` adapter, which is a chat adapter that
can also handle context-aware conversations and tasks.

In addition to the frontend context tracking, you will need a middleware to track context and provide it to the AI
system or LLM that you are using.

In the case of this demo, it's done through
[`@nlbridge/express`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nlbridge/express), a Node.js library which enables context tracking. You
can also implement easily implement your own middleware to track context and use it with the `NLUX` UI via adapters.

## Run The Demo

You can download the code for the demo application and run it on your local machine.<br />
The code is available at the following GitHub repository:

* [https://github.com/nluxai/demos](https://github.com/nluxai/demos)

Here is a step-by-step guide to run the demo application locally:

#### 1. Clone the repository:

Clone the [`nluxai/demos`](https://github.com/nluxai/demos) repository to your local machine and navigate to the
`stock-wiz-ai` directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nluxai/demos.git nlux-demos
cd nlux-demos/stock-wiz/stock-wiz-ai/
```

#### 2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Get the OpenAI API key:

* If you don't have an account, go to the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/signup" target="_blank">OpenAI signup page</a> and create an account.
* Go to the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/api-keys" target="_blank">API keys page</a>
* Click the `Creat new secret key` button

/>

* Give your API key a name and click `Create secret key`
* Copy the API key and save it in a safe place. You will need it in the next step.

#### 4. Run the demo middleware:

Assuming that your have your OpenAI API key in the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx @nlbridge/server --api openai --port 8899
```

If you don't have the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable set, you can use the `--api-key` flag to set the OpenAI API key in the command line:

```bash
npx @nlbridge/server --api openai --port 8899 --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

#### 5. Run the demo application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once the application is running, open your browser and navigate the URL displayed in the terminal.
