Guides and learning resources to help you master building conversational AI interfaces with `NLUX`.

# Overview

`NLUX` is an open-source JavaScript library for **creating elegant and performant conversational user interfaces**.
It provides a vanilla JavaScript API as well as React JS components and hooks to integrate chatbot capabilities
into your web apps and websites with minimal effort.

The library's mission is to enable developers to quickly build interactive conversational experiences by handling all
the complexities behind the scenes. You can connect it to AI backends like ChatGPT or build your own custom adapters.

## NLUX in 2 lines

Here is how the integration looks like in a React app:

```tsx
const adapter = useChatAdapter({url: '<YOUR AI ENDPOINT URL>'});
return <AiChat adapter={adapter} />;
```

And the result is:

<CodeEditor
    files={{
        'App.tsx': app,
        'adapter.ts': adapter,
    }}
    previewOnly={true}
    editorHeight={450}
    simulatedPrompt={'How an AI assistant can enhance my website\'s user experience?'}
/>

<br />
**You can customize the chatbot in many ways:** Connect to any AI backend / Customize the UI / Add chat personas for
a better chat experience / Load conversation history / and more.
