 * For example, if the user sends a message and the AI reply fails, the entire chat segment will be

 * - userMessageReceived: A message from the user has been received. For new segments triggered by user messages,

 *
 * - aiMessageReceived: A message from the AI has been fully received. This is only emitted for segments with data
 * transfer mode set to 'batch', which means the AI sends the entire message at once and not in chunks.
 *
 * - aiMessageStreamStarted: A message from the AI has started streaming. This is only emitted for segments with data
 * transfer mode set to 'stream', and when a message is about to start streaming. This event will be followed by
 * 'aiChunkReceived' events.
 *
 * - aiChunkReceived: A chunk of data from the AI has been received. This is only emitted for segments with data
 * transfer mode set to 'stream', and when a message is being streamed. Multiple 'aiChunkReceived' events can be
 * emitted for a single message.
 *
 * - aiMessageStreamed: A message from the AI has been fully streamed. This is only emitted for segments with data
 * transfer mode set to 'stream', and when a message has been fully streamed.
 *
 * - aiServerComponentStreamStarted: A server component from the AI has started streaming. This is only emitted for
 * segments with data transfer mode set to 'stream' when the adapter used is a server component adapter.
 *
 * - aiServerComponentStreamed: A server component from the AI has been fully streamed. This is only emitted for
 * segments with data transfer mode set to 'stream' when the adapter used is a server component adapter.
 *
 * - complete: The chat segment has concluded and no more items will be added or updated. It does not imply that the
 * segment was successful, only that it has ended. You should check the status of the segment to determine if it was
 * successful or not.
 *
 * - error: The chat segment has encountered an error and has ended. This can be due to a failure in the AI response,
 * streaming failure, adapter failure, or any other error that occurred during the execution of the segment. You
 * should error payloads to determine the cause of the error.
