# Chat Personas

With `NLUX`, you can optionally define **a assistant persona** and **a user persona** that will appear in the chat.

Using personas enhances natural conversation with your intelligent assistant.<br />
It allows you to **give your assistant an identity** that persists during the interaction.
This includes details like a name, profile picture, and a custom tagline.
Similarly you can also **represent the user profile** with a name and a profile picture.

<PlatformSelector reactJs={ReactJs} javascript={JavaScript}/>

## Assistant Persona

When defined, the assistant persona will appear in 2 places:

* **In the initial chat screen**, before the user has sent any message.
* **In the conversation**, in front of each message received from the AI assistant.

When defining the assistant persona, you can specify the following properties:

* The **name** of the assistant.
* The **profile picture** of the assistant.
* A **tagline** that will appear below the assistant's name.

### How To Define The Assistant Persona

<PlatformSection reactJs={AssistantPersonaReactJs} javascript={AssistantPersonaJavaScript}/>

When a string is passed to the `picture` property, it is assumed to be a URL to an image. You can also pass a JSX
element to the `picture` property, which is useful if you want to use an SVG image or a custom component.

If an invalid URL is passed to the `picture` property, the first letter of the assistant's name will be used as the avatar
image, as shown in the example below.

| Initial screen with invalid picture URL | Conversation with invalid picture URL |

## User Persona

When defined, the user persona will appear in that conversation UI, in front of the user sent.

When defining the user persona, you can specify the following properties:

* The **name** of the user.
* The **profile picture** of the user.
