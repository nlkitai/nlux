# Custom Adapters

If you're building your own APIs and you would like to use `NLUX` as the UI for your own AI assistant,
you can do so by creating a custom adapter.

There are 2 types of custom adapters that you can create:

* Streaming Adapters
* Batch Adapters

## Stream Adapters

Streaming adapters are used when the API sends responses in a stream (e.g. WebSockets, or Server-Sent Events).

The advantage of using a streaming adapter is that **the chat UI will be updated in real-time while the LLM is still
generating text**. This is particularly useful if the API takes a long time to process a request and sends responses
in a stream. Most major LLM APIs (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic) support streaming responses.
