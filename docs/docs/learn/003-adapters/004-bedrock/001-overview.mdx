# Bedrock Adapter

`NLUX` offers integration with Bedrock SDK API.

## About Bedrock

Bedrock is a versatile framework designed for creating, configuring, and managing AI-driven chat applications. It provides a robust set of tools and features to streamline the integration of AI models, handle data transfer efficiently, and customize inference configurations. This documentation provides an overview of Bedrock's key components and their functionalities.

## Supported Features

The `NLUX` LangServe adapter can do the following:

- Offers a way to **send a user prompt to a Bedrock API**.
- **Handles the API responses** and displays them in the chat UI (single responses and streamed text).

If you have specific requirements that are not covered by the adapter, please submit a feature request
[here](https://github.com/nlkitai/nlux/discussions) and we will consider adding it to the roadmap
if enough users request it.

## Example: Bedrock Adapter With Default Settings
