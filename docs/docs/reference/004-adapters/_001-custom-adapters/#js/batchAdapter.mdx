Batch adapters can be used when the API sends responses in a single request without streaming.<br />
Batch adapters are ** easier to implement**.

In order to implement a batch promise adapter for `NLUX`, you need to implement the following interface:

```tsx
interface ChatAdapter<AiMsg = string> {
    batchText: (
        message: string,
        extras: ChatAdapterExtras<AiMsg>,
    ) => Promise<AiMsg>;
}
```

The `batchText` method takes 1 parameter:

* `message` - The prompt message typed by the user, to be sent to the API.
* `extras` - An object containing [additional information](#adapter-extras) that the adapter might need.

The `batchText` method should return a promise that resolves to the response from the API.
