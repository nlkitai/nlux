This package enables the integration between NLUX and OpenAI's API.  
More specifically ‚Äï the package include the adapter to connect to text generation models exposed
via [OpenAI Text Generation APIs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation).

Please note: This adapter connects to the OpenAI API directly from the browser and requires an API key
to be used from a web page. It's not recommended to use it in production environments, and it should only
be used for development and testing purposes.

If you would like to use OpenAI's API in a production environment, you should use the OpenAI API from a server
(such us a simple Node.js proxy server that you build) and then connect to it from your web page. You can use
NLUX with any API or LLM by **creating a custom adapter for it**.
