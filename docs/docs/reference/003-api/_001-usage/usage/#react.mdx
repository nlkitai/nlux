## useAiChatApi() Hook
<br />
<br />

The `useAiChatApi` hook is used to create an instance of the `AiChatApi` object. This object is used to interact with
the chatbot UI, such as sending messages, getting the chat history, and more.

```tsx
const api = useAiChatApi();
```

Once created, the `api` object can be passed to the `AiChat` component as a prop, and its methods can be called to
interact with the AiChat UI.

```tsx
<AiChat api={api} adapter={adapter} />
```

## API And Component Lifecycle
<br />
<br />

The `AiChatApi` object has a lifecycle that is tied to the `AiChat` component. When the `AiChat` component is
unmounted, the `AiChatApi` object will be destroyed and any subsequent calls to its methods will result in an exception
being thrown.

In order to prevent this, it is recommended to create the `AiChatApi` object inside the same component that renders the
`AiChat` component, and to not store the `AiChatApi` object in a state variable or a context.

## Example
<br />
<br />

The API features work by providing creating an `AiChatApi` object and passing it to the `AiChat` component as a prop.
Calls on functions of the `AiChatApi` object will be reflected in the chatbot UI.

```jsx
import {AiChat, useAiChatApi} from 'nlux';

export default function App() {
  // Create an instance of the AiChatApi using the useAiChatApi hook
  const api = useAiChatApi();

  // Call `api.sendMessage(...)` to send a message to the chatbot
  const onClick = useCallback(() => {
    api.sendMessage('Hello, World!');
  }, [api]);

  // When creating the AiChat component, pass the `api` object as a prop
  return (
    <div>
      <AiChat api={api} adapter={adapter} />
      <button onClick={onClick}>Send Message Programmatically</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
