# LangServe Endpoints And The Data Transfer Mode

## LangServe Endpoints

When a runnable chain is served via LangServe, several endpoints are available for interacting with it.
As of version v0.0.41, a total of [8 endpoints are available](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langserve#endpoints) for each runnable chain:
5 endpoints for invoking and streaming the runnable, and 3 endpoints for getting the schema of the runnable.

Those endpoints are not always exposed. Developers can opt to expose only the endpoints they need for their use case.
For more information on how to LangServe works and how to expose endpoints, please refer to the
[LangServe Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langserve).

## Endpoints Consumed by `NLUX`

In order to build an AI chatbot with `NLUX`, **your LangServe API *should* expose one (or both) of the following endpoints**:

* `POST /my_runnable/invoke` - Invoke the runnable on a single input and return the output in a single response.
* `POST /my_runnable/stream` - Invoke the runnable on a single input and stream the output as it is generated.

The following endpoint can be used by `NLUX` when it's available, but it's **not mandatory**:

* `GET /my_runnable/input_schema` - JSON schema for input to the runnable.

## Runnable URL Configuration

The `url` property is the only mandatory property for the LangServe adapter.
It should include the URL to your LangServe runnable API **without any endpoint** at the end.

Example:

* Good ✅ ― `https://pynlux.api.nlkit.com/pirate-speak`
* Bad ❌ ― `https://pynlux.api.nlkit.com/pirate-speak/invoke`

<PlatformSelector reactJs={UrlConfigReactJs} javascript={UrlConfigJavaScript}/>

## Data Transfer Mode

The **default** [data transfer mode](/reference/adapters/langchain-langserve#data-transfer-mode) for `NLUX` LangServe adapter is `stream`.
This means that the output is streamed as it is generated by the runnable. This allows for faster response times and
better user experience, as the user can see the output as it is generated.

If your endpoint only exposes the `POST /my_runnable/invoke` endpoint, you can still use the `NLUX` LangServe adapter,
but you will need to set the [data transfer mode](/reference/adapters/langchain-langserve#data-transfer-mode) to `batch`.

The table below summarizes the data transfer, the endpoints that should be exposed, and the expected behavior:

| Data Transfer Mode | LangServe Endpoint      | Expected Behavior |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| `stream`&nbsp;(default)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | `POST`&nbsp;`/my_runnable/stream`    | Output is streamed as it is generated by the runnable. |
| `batch`            | `POST`&nbsp;`/my_runnable/invoke`    | Output is returned in a single response once the runnable has finished processing the input. |

:::note Important
In order for the `NLUX` LangServe adapter to work **in `stream` mode**, the LangServe API should expose the
`POST`&nbsp;`/my_runnable/stream` endpoint. If your LangServe API only exposes the `POST`&nbsp;`/my_runnable/invoke` endpoint,
you should set the [data transfer mode](/reference/adapters/langchain-langserve#data-transfer-mode) to `batch`.

### Example: LangServe Adapter With `batch` Data Transfer Mode

The example below shows how to use the `NLUX` LangServe adapter to connect to a LangServe API.

* LangServe Runnable URL used: `https://pynlux.api.nlkit.com/pirate-speak`
* Data transfer mode used: `batch` ― The reply is returned in a single response once the runnable has finished
processing the input (longer response time).

:::info Try It Out
You can edit the live code of the example above to switch the `dataTransferMode` to `stream` and notice the difference.
