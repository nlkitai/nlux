Stream adapters can be used to send the response as a stream of chunks, as it's being received from the API.<br />
Stream adapters provide a more responsive chat experience.

In order to implement a custom streaming adapter for `NLUX`, you can use the following hook:

```tsx
import {useStreamAdapter} from '@nlux/react';
```

```tsx
useStreamAdapter<AiMsg = string>(send: StreamSend)
```

Where `send` is a function that developers should implement and pass as a parameter to the hook. It's responsible for
sending the prompt to the API and receiving the responses as a stream of chunks.

The `send` function has the following signature:

```tsx
export type StreamSend<AiMsg> = (
    message: string,
    observer: StreamingAdapterObserver<AiMsg>,
    extras: ChatAdapterExtras<AiMsg>,
) => void;
```

It takes 3 parameters:

* `message` - The prompt message typed by the user, to be sent to the API.
* `observer` - An observer that will receive the responses from the API and pass them to `NLUX`.
* `extras` - An object containing [additional information](#adapter-extras) that the adapter might need.

Below is the definition of the `StreamingAdapterObserver` interface:

```tsx
interface StreamingAdapterObserver<ChunkType = string> {
    next: (chunk: ChunkType) => void;
    error: (error: Error) => void;
    complete: () => void;
}
```

When implementing your `send`, use the `observer.next(chunk)` method when data is received from the API.<br />
The `observer.complete()` method should be called when the API has finished sending responses,<br />
and the `observer.error()` method should be called if an error occurs.

When the `adapter` is used in the `<AiChat adapter={adapter} />` component, `NLUX` will take care of calling the
`send` method with the appropriate parameters and updating the chat UI with the response, or an error message if the
promise is rejected.
