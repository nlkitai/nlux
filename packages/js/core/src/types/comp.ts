 * It also contains a map of actions that depend on DOM elements `actions` (such as focus, set active, etc.).
 * The `onDestroy` callback is called when the component is destroyed, and should be used to clean up any resources.
 *
 * Please note: The `elements` map does not include all elements that are mounted in the DOM tree, but only those
 * that are explicitly added to the map by the renderer. Those elements are usually used by parent component
 * to mount subcomponents, or by the updater function to update the DOM tree when a prop changes.
