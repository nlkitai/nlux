`NLUX` is React and JavaScript open-source library for building conversational AI interfaces. It makes it super simple
to build web applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI. With just a few  lines of code, you can add
conversational AI capabilities and interact with your favourite AI models.

## Try `NLUX` 🚀

Use `nlux-cli` to quickly spin up a new `Next.js`, `React`, or `Vanilla TypeScript` project with NLUX integrated.

## Design Principles ⚜️

The following design principles guide the development of `NLUX`:

* **Intuitive** ― Interactions enabled by `NLUX` should be intuitive.
  Usage should unfold naturally without obstacles or friction. No teaching or thinking
  should be required to use UI built with `NLUX`.

* **Performant** ― `NLUX` should be as fast as possible. Fast to load, fast to render
  and update, fast to respond to user input. To achieve that, we should avoid unnecessary
  work, optimize for performance, minimize bundle size, and not depend on external libraries.

* **Accessible** ― UI built with `NLUX` should be accessible to everyone. It should be usable
  by people with disabilities, on various devices, in various environments, and using various
  input methods (keyboard, touch, voice).

* **DX** ― `NLUX` recognizes developers as first-class citizens. The library should enable an
  optimal DX (developer experience). It should be effortless to use, easy to understand, and
  simple to extend. Stellar documentation should be provided. The feature roadmap should evolve
  aligning to developer needs voiced.

## Mission 👨‍🚀

Our mission is **to enable developers to build outstanding LLM front-ends and applications**,
cross platforms, with a focus on performance and usability.
