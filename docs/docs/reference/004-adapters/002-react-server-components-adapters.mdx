# React Server Components as Adapters

With `NLUX`, **React Server Components** (RSC) can be directly used as a chat response and rendered to the user in the
chat UI. This enables a rich and more interactive experience, and an enhanced chatbot interface.

## About React Server Components
<br /><br />

At their core, [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) (RSC) are an HTML
representation that's being written in React/JSX syntax. They are rendered on the server and sent to the client in a
serialized form that can be interpreted by the React client runtime and rendered as a part of the React component tree.

:::note RSC and Next.js
React Server Components are tightly integrated with Next.js. Pages in Next.js are server components by default, and
the `'use server'` directive is widely used to explicitly indicate that a component should be rendered on the server
(as page, or server component).

The NLUX RSC adapter has been designed and developed with Next.js as the primary use-case. However, it can be used with
any other RSC compatible server-side rendering setup.

## Usage
<br /><br />

```tsx
export default async function MyServerComponent<AiMsg>(
    message: string,
    extras: ChatAdapterExtras<AiMsg>,
) {
    // Your logic here
    // ...

    // Return the generated content in JSX format
    return <div>Generated Content</div>;
}
```

The React Server Component should be **a default export function** that takes 2 parameters:
* `message` - The prompt message typed by the user, to be sent to the API.
* `extras` - An object containing [additional information](/reference/adapters/custom-adapters#adapter-extras) that the adapter might need.

> **On The Client:**

```tsx
import {AiChat, useAsRscAdapter} from '@nlux/react';
```
```tsx
useAsRscAdapter<AiMsg = string>(
    import('path/to/server-component'),
    loader?: ReactNode,
);
```

The `useAsRscAdapter` hook takes 2 parameters:
* `import('path/to/server-component')` - The path to the server component that should be used as the adapter.
* `loader` - An optional ReactNode that will be displayed while the server component is being loaded.

The `useAsRscAdapter` hook returns an adapter that can be used in the `<AiChat adapter={adapter} />` component.
When a user sends a message, NLUX will take care of calling the server component with the appropriate parameters and
updating the chat UI with the response as it's being received.
