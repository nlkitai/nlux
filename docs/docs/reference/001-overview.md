# Overview

## Layers

`NLUX` is a highly customizable and fully featured conversational AI UI library with 2 main layers:

* **[The User Interface Layer](/reference/ui)** 🎨 — Which is responsible for `everything that gets rendered` on the
  screen, such as the user and the AI messages, the prompt composer, and the markdown received from AI.
* **[The Adapters Layer](/learn/adapters)** 🔌 — Which enables the `integration with AI backends` by handling API calls,
  response streaming, and more. It also allows for `custom adapters` to be built for any backend.

## Platforms

`NLUX` is available in 2 flavors:

* **`NLUX` React JS** ⚛️ — React JS implementation using the React rendering engine, components, and hooks.
* **`NLUX` JavaScript** 🟨 — Pure JavaScript library that can be used with any web framework (such as Vue) or with plain HTML.

You'll find a toggle at the top of each documentation page that allows switching between the 2 platforms.
