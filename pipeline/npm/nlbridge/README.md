This package enables the integration between `NLUX JS` and `nlbridge` ― the middleware library
for building conversational AI interfaces.

## About `nlbridge`

`nlbridge` is a lightweight middleware library that provides a simple and flexible interface to integrate
conversational AI interfaces into your web app or website. It acts as a bridge between your front-end
and the language model API, providing a simple and consistent API to interact with several LLMs.

`nlbridge` is developed by the same team behind `NLUX`, and is designed to work seamlessly with `NLUX`.

### Vanilla JS 🟨 vs React JS ⚛️

This package `@nlux/nlbridge` is meant for use with the vanilla JS version of `NLUX`.
If you're looking for the React JS version, please check
the [`@nlux/nlbridge-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nlux/nlbridge-react) package.
