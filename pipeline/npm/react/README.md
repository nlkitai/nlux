## Get Started With `NLUX React` ðŸš€

The example below demonstrates how to create an AI chat interface using `NLUX React` and `LangChain`, the open source
framework for building LLM backends. But you can use `NLUX` **with any LLM** â€• either
via the [standard adapters](https://docs.nlkit.com/nlux/learn/adapters) provided, or
by creating [your own adapter](https://docs.nlkit.com/nlux/learn/adapters/custom-adapters/create-custom-adapter).

To get started with `NLUX React` and LangChain, install the `@nlux/react` and `@nlux/langchain-react` packages:

```sh
npm install @nlux/react @nlux/langchain-react
```

Then include `<AiChat />` in your React app to get started.<br />
Use the `useChatAdapter` hook to configure an adapter for your LLM.

```jsx
import {AiChat} from '@nlux/react';
import {useChatAdapter} from '@nlux/langchain-react';

const App = () => {
    const gptAdapter = useChatAdapter({
        url: 'https://<Your LangServe Runnable URL>'
    });

    return (
        <AiChat
            adapter={gptAdapter}
            composerOptions={{
                placeholder: 'How can I help you today?'
            }}
            conversationOptions={{
                historyPayloadSize: 'max'
            }}
        />
    );
}
```

You should also [include the NLUX theme CSS file](#theme-file-and-css-) in your HTML page
or import it in your React app.

## And The Result Is âœ¨

An AI chatbot, powered by LangChain, that can understand and respond to user messages:

## Theme File and CSS ðŸŽ¨

You should include a **theme CSS file** into your HTML page.<br />
The recommended way for React developers is to install `@nlux/themes`

```sh
npm install @nlux/themes
```

Then import the theme CSS file into your app or component as follows:

```jsx
import '@nlux/themes/nova.css';
```

This requires that your bundler is configured to load CSS files.
