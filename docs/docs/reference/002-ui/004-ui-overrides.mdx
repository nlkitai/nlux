# UI Overrides

`NLUX` is a very flexible conversational AI UI library.<br />
We allow for customization via a wide range of config options,
and we provide a powerful theming system.

On top of all that, **developers can also override some of the default UI components** in the AI chat area with their own
React components and JSX, as explained in this reference page.

---

## Usage

You can override the JSX of certain UI components by passing a custom container component to the `AiChat` component
with your JSX elements inside it.

Here is an example of how you can override loader component displayed across multiple parts of NLUX:

```jsx
import {AiChat} from '@nlux/react';
import {AiChatUI} from '@nlux/react';
import {useChatAdapter} from '@nlux/<platform>-adapter'; // Or use a custom adapter

const MyAiChatApp = () => {
    const myAdapter = useChatAdapter({ /* Your adapter options */ });
    return (
        <AiChat adapter={myAdapter}>
            <AiChatUI.Loader>
                <span className="rounded">Loading 👻</span>
            </AiChatUI.Loader>
        </AiChat>
    );
};
```

The inner JSX element `<AiChatUI.Loader><span className="rounded">Loading 👻</span></AiChatUI.Loader>` will instruct
`NLUX` to replace the default loader component with the custom loader component provided as a child:

```jsx
<span className="rounded">Loading 👻</span>
```

## UI Overrides Supported

Below is a list of UI component overrides that are currently supported:

---

> ### Loader

This enables overriding the loading spinner displayed in 2 locations:

* Inside the default submit button, when it's in a loading state.
* Under a message, when it's being loaded from the server or streaming.

You can override it with your own JSX element by using the `AiChatUI.Loader` component:

> * Overriding Container: `AiChatUI.Loader`
> * Usage:

```jsx
<AiChat adapter={myAdapter}>
    <AiChatUI.Loader>
        <span className="rounded">Loading 👻</span>
    </AiChatUI.Loader>
</AiChat>
```

---

> ### Greeting

The `Greeting` component (previously referred to as the `Welcome Message` component) is displayed when the chat is first
opened, and when the conversation history is empty.

![Nova Theme Overview](/images/reference/ui-overrides/greeting-overrides.png)

You can override it with your own JSX element by using the `AiChatUI.Greeting` component:

> * Overriding Container: `AiChatUI.Greeting`
> * Usage:

```jsx
<AiChat adapter={myAdapter}>
    <AiChatUI.Greeting>
        <span className="rounded">Hello! 👋</span>
    </AiChatUI.Greeting>
</AiChat>
```

## Adding More Overrides
<br /><br />

We will be adding more customization options and overrides as we receive feedback from the community.

If your project requires more customization options, **please let us know**:

* You can either open an issue on the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/nlkitai/nlux/discussions) page
* Or simply suggest it in the [NLUX Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/SRwDmZghNB)

UI overrides are only supported for the React JS version of `NLUX` at the moment.
